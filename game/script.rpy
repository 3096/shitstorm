    s "Are you nervous?"
    j "Me? Nervous? No way- I mean, are you nervous? Because I'm not nervous."
    s "So you are nervous."
    j "... maybe"

    s "*laughs* I knew it. You've been acting strange all day. What's going on inside your head? Almost feels like you're hiding something."
    j "Well, you told me before that your moter can be..."
    s "Difficult?"
    j "Sometimes.. So, of course I'm nervous to meet her! WHat if she doesn't like me?"
    s "It's true that she's hard to plase... but it'll just be one dinner together. We should be fine."
    j "I guess... but, I'm not really the type of person people would want to bring home to their parents you know? I just don't want to let you down..."
    s "Hey, listen to me. You're not the person who pulled those silly pranks back in high school anymore. You're the person who I fell in love with. You're smart and ambitious, I've never met anyone as amazing as you. If my mother can't see that, then that's her loss"
    j "But... what if..."

    a "Get your shit together, John. Who cares if she doesn't like you? If worse comes to worst, you and Scott were doing fine without her anyways, so what's the big deal?"
    j "Maybe you're right Angel... I think I really needed to hear that."
    a "I just don't want you to overthink this..."
    j "And I appreciate it. THanks for coming with us today. You're my favorite family member."
    a "Of course, I'm the best."
    a "Wait. Mom and dad cut you off... so doesn't that make me your only family member?"
    j "..."
    a "idiot."

    s " *laughs* Your sister was rightm you know? About how we don't need my mother's approval. No matter what happens today, we're in this together"
    j "Thanks, Scott..."
    a "Where's my thank you?"
    j "thankkkk youuu Angel"
    a "heh"
    a "How much longer is it till we get ot the house? I feel like we've been together in this car forever now"
    s "Actually, we're pulling in now.. Welcome to the Charmin household."

    # John, Angel, and Scott's POV of the front of the house

    s "Are you guys ready?"
    j "...Mhm"
    a "Let's just meet the lady and get this over with"

    m "You've gained weight, Scott."
    s "Ah ha ha.... Hello, mother... I'd like you to meet-"
    m "I assume you must be the girlfriend"
    a "PFFT *gags* ahem, uh no. That \"girlfriend\" would be him."

    j "Um... hello Ms.Charmin."
    s "Mother, as I was trying to tell you, this is my partner John Doe. And this is his younger sister Angel."
    m "Oh, I see. How disappointing..."

    j "Um...uh... it's a, um, pleasure to finally meet you Ms.Charmin. Scott told me... um.. so much about you!"
    m "Then he must've told you, I really despise mumbling. Speak up"
    s "Mother, that's enough. Can we come in now?"
    m "*sighs* I suppose.. Though, I wasn't aware three of you will be coming over. There's only food prepared for us, there won't be enough for the short one."
    a "(The short one... IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME???)"

    s "That's fine, I can cook something up. C'mon guys, let's head inside."
    m "..."

    j "Um.. th-thank you for welcoming us into your home, Ms.Ch-"
    m "Who even taught you to wear your tie like that? It looks awful."
    a "Just shut up and go in, John."

    j "Yeah... I am."
    a "The audacity of that b*tch"
    j "I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... I just ruin everything..."
    s "Stop that! You didn't ruin anything at all."
    s "I should be the one who should be sorry... after all these years, I thought she would change."
    s "She never did."

    a "Honestly f*ck that b*tch."
    j "Please... Angel... She might hear us."
    a "I'm not gonna apologize for that if SHE CAN HEAR US!! Scott is making such a nice dinner for us and she wanted to repay that BY SLAPPING YOU?"
    j "There's not much we can do here..."

    a "Honestly, if that's how she treats people cooking her a meal, I bet there's a ton more at resturants that are just spitting in her food."
    j "Why don't we teach her a lesson?"
    a "You don't mean..."
    j "It'll just be like good ol' times.. All over again..!"
    j "It'll be harmless like those pranks that get views on the internet."

    a "No way man, that's Scott's mother you're talking about. She's sh*tty but we can't be that petty. We're not little kids anymore."
    s "She did hurt John... She's no mother of mine anymore."

    a "..."
    j "Sh*tty... like laxatives!"
    a "Sorry what now?"
    j "Let's just put a small dosage into her food. She won't suspect anything!"
    s "Sure, let's do it."
