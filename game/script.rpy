    j "Me? Nervous? No way- I mean, are you nervous? Because I'm not nervous."
    s "So you are nervous."
    j "... maybe"

    s "*laughs* I knew it. You've been acting strange all day. What's going on inside your head? Almost feels like you're hiding something."
    j "Well, you told me before that your moter can be..."
    s "Difficult?"
    j "Sometimes.. So, of course I'm nervous to meet her! WHat if she doesn't like me?"
    s "It's true that she's hard to plase... but it'll just be one dinner together. We should be fine."
    j "I guess... but, I'm not really the type of person people would want to bring home to their parents you know? I just don't want to let you down..."
    s "Hey, listen to me. You're not the person who pulled those silly pranks back in high school anymore. You're the person who I fell in love with. You're smart and ambitious, I've never met anyone as amazing as you. If my mother can't see that, then that's her loss"
    j "But... what if..."

    a "Get your shit together, John. Who cares if she doesn't like you? If worse comes to worst, you and Scott were doing fine without her anyways, so what's the big deal?"
    j "Maybe you're right Angel... I think I really needed to hear that."
    a "I just don't want you to overthink this..."
    j "And I appreciate it. THanks for coming with us today. You're my favorite family member."

    j "thankkkk youuu Angel"
    a "heh"

    j "Um... hello Ms.Charmin."
    s "Mother, as I was trying to tell you, this is my partner John Doe. And this is his younger sister Angel."
    m "Oh, I see. How disappointing..."

    j "Um...uh... it's a, um, pleasure to finally meet you Ms.Charmin. Scott told me... um.. so much about you!"
    m "Then he must've told you, I really despise mumbling. Speak up"
    s "Mother, that's enough. Can we come in now?"
    m "*sighs* I suppose.. Though, I wasn't aware three of you will be coming over. There's only food prepared for us, there won't be enough for the short one."

    j "There's not much we can do here..."

    a "Honestly, if that's how she treats people cooking her a meal, I bet there's a ton more at resturants that are just spitting in her food."
    j "Why don't we teach her a lesson?"
    a "You don't mean..."
    j "It'll just be like good ol' times.. All over again..!"
    j "It'll be harmless like those pranks that get views on the internet."
